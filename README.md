# BouncyBall
   HTML5 Project: HTML + Javascript + CSS  
   Inspired by [Jongmin Kim](https://blog.cmiscm.com/) (Interactive Developer)
  
## Attention
    The spawn location of the balls are random
    Balls might be generated inside a block
    If that's the case, refresh the page to see the bouncy animation :)
